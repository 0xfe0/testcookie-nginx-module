{"name":"testcookie-nginx-module","body":"Description\r\n===========\r\n\r\n**testcookie-nginx-module** is a simple robot mitigation module using cookie based challenge/response technique.\r\n\r\nChallenge cookies can be set using different methods:\r\n\r\n*   \"Set-Cookie\" + 301 HTTP Location redirect\r\n*   \"Set-Cookie\" + HTML meta refresh redirect\r\n\r\n![Simple mode](http://habrastorage.org/storage2/039/931/1a9/0399311a9a4257fd6298fe1e2d4e098c.png)\r\n\r\n*   Custom template, JavaScript can be used here.\r\n\r\n![Javascript mode](http://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a2/d5a/3cf/5a2d5a3cf0fed6ebfc3865556ef65c54.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prevent automatic parsing, challenge cookie value can be encrypted with AES-128 in CBC mode using custom/random key and iv, and then decrypted at client side with JavaScript using [SlowAES](http://code.google.com/p/slowaes/).\r\n\r\nIf you need Flash or Captcha, check [testcookie-flash-processor](http://github.com/kyprizel/testcookie-flash-processor).\r\n\r\nSupport the project\r\n===================\r\n\r\nDonations are appreciated, please use the [Pledgie](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/17224) system which accepts Paypal payments or contact the author directly.\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n====\r\n\r\nFeel free to report bugs and send patches to kyprizel@gmail.com\r\nor using [github's issue tracker](http://github.com/kyprizel/testcookie-nginx-module/issues).\r\n\r\nCopyright & License\r\n===================\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2011-2012 Eldar Zaitov (kyprizel@gmail.com).\r\n\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nThis module is licenced under the terms of BSD license.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\r\nmet:\r\n\r\n    *   Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n    *   Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n    *   Neither the name of the authors nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS ``AS IS'' AND\r\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\r\nARE DISCLAIMED.
